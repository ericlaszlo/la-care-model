# LA Care Interview Presentation

We need a 45 minute presentation with the L.A. Care Data Science 
team to deliver a virtual presentation on a project that we have 
completed. The project can be a work project, school project, or 
a passion project. The subject is left to the discretion of the
candidate, so long  as it falls within the realm of "data science".

This project will build the model used in an application for 
discussion in this presentation.

## Getting Started

Create a virtual environment and load the required packages using
the requirements.txt file. Then load the data and build the model
by using the two commands in the makefile.

## Prerequisites

python 3, pip, make
